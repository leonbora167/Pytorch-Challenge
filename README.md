Pytorch is an open-source machine library for Python based on Torch. It has been primarily developed by Facebook's artificial intelligence research group.It is written in C++,Python and CUDA.
Its primarily used for Numpy like Tensor calculation using GPU and for Neural Network.
Compared to other Deep Learning frameworks, Pytorch is very thin and making neural networks here actually does require a good sound knowledge of deep learning from scratch, making it best for begineers trying to learn DL from scratch.
Some of the modules used here are 
* Auto Grad Module
* nn Module
* Optim module

*Facebook Artificial Intelligence researchers seek to understand and develop systems with human-level intelligence by advancing the longer-term academic problems surrounding AI. Our research covers the full spectrum of topics related to AI, and to deriving knowledge from data: theory, algorithms, applications, software infrastructure and hardware infrastructure. Long-term objectives of understanding intelligence and building intelligent machines are bold and ambitious, and we know that making significant progress towards AI can’t be done in isolation. That’s why we actively engage with the research community through publications, open source software, participation in technical conferences and workshops, and collaborations with colleagues in academia.*
